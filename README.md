Technology Stack

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

Access the Application
Open your web browser.

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Use the dropdown menu to switch between Interview Questions, Interview Practice Chat, and Resume Feedback.

Follow on-screen instructions to input your job role, chat, or paste your resume.

Usage Instructions
Interview Questions Mode
Enter the job role and click Get Interview Questions to receive sample interview questions and answers tailored to your role.
You can then click Start Practice Chat to enter a conversational mode with AI assistance.

Interview Practice Chat Mode
Chat naturally about interview questions, your answers, or ask for advice.
The bot keeps track of your conversation to provide contextual and helpful feedback.

Resume Feedback Mode
Paste your resume text into the textbox and click Get Resume Feedback.
The bot analyzes and returns suggestions for a better, more effective resume.

Notes
This app uses in-memory session data, meaning session history will reset if the server restarts or if you open the app in a different browser/device.

The AI output aims to be helpful but is not guaranteed perfectâ€”always review suggestions critically.

The current version supports resume text paste only; support for file upload is upcoming.

Potential Improvements
Enable uploading PDF/DOCX resume files for direct parsing.

Persist session data in a database or Redis for longer conversations.

Add user authentication to save profiles and history.

Enhance the frontend with richer UI/UX and mobile responsiveness.

Deploy to cloud platforms (Heroku, Google Cloud, AWS) for online access.
